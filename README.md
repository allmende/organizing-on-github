# Organizing on Github

We use github (this website!) to discuss things. If you're not used to that, here's a [quick video intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlrJVSJRUN4).

## What's this?

Recently, lots of communities and projects have begun using Github to organize meetups, brainstorm ideas, and plan events.
We want to share examples and information on how to use Github effectively to build and nurture communities.

Some non-technical people can be overwhelmed by Github, from the strange jargon to the subtle, label-free user interface. We
also want to use this repository to collect the best "Github 101" resources to get people comfortable participating and contributing
to discussions.

## Communities on Github

### [Knode](https://github.com/knode)

a resource for the node.js and javascript community. meetup organizers share their secret recipes from various local meetups.
there's also a speaker directory to help get visibility for those wanting to speak and to help meetup and conference organizers
find great guests to invite to their events. there are a variety of other resources as well. knode makes great use of multiple
repositories to organize information.

### [Maptime](https://github.com/maptime)

a learning community for map makers. several local chapters have begun creating repositories and organizing meetups via issues.
there are also other educational materials. people can make their first pull request by editing a map in geoJSON format, which
Github conveniently visualizes on a map.

### [Code for America](https://github.com/codeforamerica)

with more than its fair share of actual code repositories, Code for America also maintains several "ideas" repos, such as these
for [healthcare applications](https://github.com/codeforamerica/health-project-ideas) and [open trails](https://github.com/codeforamerica/opentrails-project-ideas).
The issues section on these repositories provides and easy way to organize ideas from all members of the community in a public
way, without using email or private chat or other complicated web apps. And when it comes time to start prototyping app ideas,
they can easily be linked from the original ideas thread, keeping the ideas close to the code.

### [BeerJS](https://github.com/beerjs)

with chapters in [18 cities around the world](https://github.com/beerjs/meta/blob/master/locations.geojson), BeerJS is one of the
oldest and largest groups using Github for organizing that we know of. Each local chapter gets a repository named after their geographic location,
as well as a separate group with administrative rights on that repository. This allows for clean separation of permissions in a way that reflects
the decentralized leadership structure of the organization. There is also an @organizers group to allow global user tagging, and a [`/meta`](https://github.com/beerjs/meta)
repository to have discussion about the organization. New chapters are formed by the new organizers opening an issue on `/meta`.

### [nodeschool](http://nodeschool.io)

[nodeschool](http://nodeschool.io/) uses github for [hosting workshop code](https://github.com/rvagg/learnyounode), as a [support forum](https://github.com/nodeschool/discussions/), as a [free website host](https://github.com/nodeschool/nodeschool.github.io), and for [teacher discussion and planning](https://github.com/nodeschool/discussions/issues/93)
